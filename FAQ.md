# FAQ

## Why?

When starting CS270, I hadn't written C in a while.
So this was a way for me to de-rust myself.

## Did you only put this in source control after already writing it? I can't see much of a repository history.

I initially had this in my git repo for the class at large, which includes all notes, as well as all projects.
I later decided that it was good enough to share with the world, so I moved it out, and was too lazy to copy over the history.
